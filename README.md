# **DeepSeek + LangChain Integration: Custom Prompt Engine & Tic-Tac-Toe Game**  

Welcome to my project repository! This project showcases the integration of **DeepSeek-V3** with **LangChain** to create a **custom Prompt Engine** using the **DeepSeek R1 (1.5B parameters)** model. Additionally, I‚Äôve built a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** powered by the same setup to demonstrate the versatility of this integration.  

---

## **Overview**  
This project combines cutting-edge technologies to build intelligent, context-aware systems. Here‚Äôs what it includes:  
1. **Custom Prompt Engine**: A tool to generate and fine-tune prompts using **DeepSeek R1 (1.5B)**.  
2. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: A fun, interactive game where the AI generates moves dynamically.  
3. **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly UI for interacting with the system.  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **LangChain**: For building chain-based workflows and integrating with external data sources.  
- **Python**: The core programming language used for development.  
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive and intuitive user interface.  
- **Ollama**: For seamless model deployment and management.  
- **DeepSeek R1 (1.5B)**: A lightweight yet powerful LLM for prompt engineering and game logic.

## **Features**  
### **1. Custom Prompt Engine**  
- Generate high-quality prompts tailored to specific use cases.  
- Fine-tune outputs by adjusting parameters dynamically.  
- Integrate with LangChain for advanced workflows like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and more.  

### **2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game**  
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI powered by **DeepSeek R1 (1.5B)**.  
- The AI dynamically generates moves based on the current board state.  
- Built using **Streamlit** for an interactive gaming experience.

## **How It Works**  
### **Prompt Engine**  
The Prompt Engine uses **DeepSeek R1 (1.5B)** to generate and fine-tune prompts. Here‚Äôs a snippet of the core logic:  

```python
from langchain import LLMChain
from deepseek import DeepSeekModel

# Initialize DeepSeek model
deepseek_model = DeepSeekModel("deepseek-r1-1.5b")

# Generate a prompt
prompt = "Generate a creative story about a robot exploring Mars."
response = deepseek_model.generate(prompt)
print(response)
```

### **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**  
The game logic uses **DeepSeek R1 (1.5B)** to determine the best move for the AI. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek:  

```python
def generate_move(board_state, model):
    prompt = f"The current Tic-Tac-Toe board state is: {board_state}. What is the best move for 'X'?"
    move = model.generate(prompt)
    return move

# Example usage
board_state = [["X", "O", ""], ["", "X", ""], ["O", "", ""]]
best_move = generate_move(board_state, deepseek_model)
print(f"Generated Move: {best_move}")
```
